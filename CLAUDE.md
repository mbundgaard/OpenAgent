# OpenAgent3

Multi-channel AI agent platform. Connects LLM providers (text, voice) to inbound channels (REST API, WebSocket, Telegram, WhatsApp, webhooks) with a shared agent personality layer.

## Project Board

https://github.com/users/mbundgaard/projects/4 — managed via `gh project` and `gh issue` CLI commands. See [docs/project-api.md](docs/project-api.md) for API reference.

## Tech Stack

- .NET 10, ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, System.Text.Json
- Node.js (Baileys bridge for WhatsApp Web protocol)
- React 19, TypeScript, Vite, CSS Modules
- xUnit + WebApplicationFactory for integration tests
- Central Package Management (Directory.Packages.props)

## Architecture Rules

### IAgentLogic is injected context, NOT an orchestrator
IAgentLogic provides system prompt, tools, message history, and tool execution. It is injected INTO LLM providers. Providers call the shots — they call `agentLogic.AddMessage()`, `GetMessages()`, `SystemPrompt`, `Tools`, and `ExecuteToolAsync()`. AgentLogic does not process messages or orchestrate completions.

### Provider pattern
Three provider types, all with IConfigurable:
- **ILlmTextProvider** — single `CompleteAsync` returning `IAsyncEnumerable<CompletionEvent>`. Used by both REST (collected) and WebSocket (streamed).
- **ILlmVoiceProvider** — creates bidirectional voice sessions
- **IChannelProvider** — inbound channel adapters (Telegram, WhatsApp). `StartAsync`/`StopAsync` lifecycle managed by `ConnectionManager`.

### Channel provider infrastructure
- **IChannelProviderFactory** — creates providers from `Connection` config. Exposes `Type`, `DisplayName`, `ConfigFields` (for dynamic UI forms), and `SetupStep` (post-creation flow like QR pairing).
- **ConnectionManager** — `IHostedService` that starts enabled connections on startup. Maintains `ConcurrentDictionary<string, IChannelProvider>` of running providers. Matches factories by `connection.Type`.
- **Connection** — persisted in `{dataPath}/config/connections.json` with `Id`, `Name`, `Type`, `Enabled`, `Config` (JsonElement blob).
- **Per-chat conversation mapping** — each platform chat (DM or group) gets its own conversation via derived ID: `{channelType}:{connectionId}:{chatId}`. Uses `GetOrCreate`.
- **Access control** — empty allowlist = allow all (open by default). Restriction is a runtime management concern, not a setup concern.

### CompletionEvent is the universal output type
`CompletionEvent` is an abstract record with three subtypes: `TextDelta`, `ToolCallEvent`, `ToolResultEvent`. Both REST and WebSocket use the same events — REST collects them into a JSON array, WebSocket streams them as individual messages.

### Tool infrastructure
- **ITool** — self-contained tool with definition (JSON Schema) and execution
- **IToolHandler** — groups related tools under a capability domain (e.g. FileSystem, Shell)
- **AgentLogic** — aggregates all tools from registered handlers, routes execution by name
- Tools are NOT part of the system prompt — providers send tool definitions to the LLM via their wire protocol
- Tool calls and results are persisted as Messages with `ToolCalls` and `ToolCallId` fields

### Conversations are created implicitly
No dedicated "create conversation" endpoint. The conversation ID is generated by the client (GUID for app) or derived from the platform chat ID (channel providers). Endpoints use `GetOrCreate` — if the conversation exists, reuse it; if not, create it. Each conversation has:
- **Source** (string) — who initiated it: `"app"`, `"telegram"`, etc.
- **Type** (ConversationType enum) — determines agent behavior and system prompt: `Text`, `Voice`, `Cron`, `WebHook`

### Endpoints are thin
Endpoints validate the request and forward to the provider. No business logic in endpoints.

### Endpoint organization
All endpoints live in `OpenAgent.Api/Endpoints/`. They are ASP.NET Core extension methods on `WebApplication`. Grouped by transport and domain:
- REST endpoints: `ConversationEndpoints`, `ChatEndpoints`, `ConnectionEndpoints`
- WebSocket endpoints: `WebSocketVoiceEndpoints`, `WebSocketTextEndpoints`
- Channel endpoints: `TelegramWebhookEndpoints`, `WhatsAppEndpoints` (QR pairing)

### Authentication
Pluggable auth via extension methods on `IServiceCollection`. Currently `AddApiKeyAuth()` validates `X-Api-Key` header against a configured key. Swap for `AddEntraIdAuth()` when migrating to Entra ID — same shape, different implementation. `/health` is anonymous, all other endpoints require authorization. Dev key in `appsettings.Development.json`, production key via `Authentication__ApiKey` environment variable on Azure.

### Interface segregation for cross-project dependencies
When `OpenAgent.Api` needs a type from the host project, extract an interface into `OpenAgent.Contracts`. Example: `IVoiceSessionManager` lives in Contracts, concrete `VoiceSessionManager` lives in the host, DI wires them.

## Coding Conventions

### Naming
- Model/entity properties: `Id` is fine
- Variables and parameters: always explicit — `conversationId`, `userId`, `sessionId`, never bare `id`
- Route parameters match: `{conversationId}` not `{id}`

### Style
- No emojis in code or comments
- XML doc comments on public classes and their public methods
- DRY, YAGNI — no premature abstractions
- `[JsonPropertyName]` attributes on all serialized models, never anonymous types for API payloads
- Inline comments to highlight method flow — make logic scannable at a glance

### Git
- Commit frequently — after each logical change, not in accumulated batches
- Concise commit messages focused on "why"

## Build and Test

```bash
cd src/agent && dotnet build
cd src/agent && dotnet test
```

## Key Design Decisions

- ConversationType drives system prompt selection — the agent behaves differently for voice vs text vs cron
- WebSocket is just transport — which LLM a WebSocket endpoint uses depends on the route, not the protocol
- VoiceSessionManager is pure session lifecycle (create, track, close) — no conversation state updates
- Text provider has a tool call loop with a 10-round safety cap
- SQLite conversation store (conversations.db in dataPath) — persistent across restarts, with schema migration via TryAddColumn
- File tools use UTF-8 without BOM, controlled from a single constant in FileSystemToolHandler
- All tools scoped to `{dataPath}` — no access outside data directory
- Data directory has standard folders: `projects/` (one per project), `repos/` (git clones), `memory/` (agent notes) — created on startup by FileSystemToolHandler
- System prompt composed from markdown files in dataPath: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, VOICE.md — loaded once at startup, filtered by ConversationType
- BuildChatMessages validates tool call rounds — skips orphaned tool calls to avoid API 400 errors
- WhatsApp uses Baileys (Node.js) as a managed child process — .NET spawns `node baileys-bridge.js`, communicates via stdin/stdout JSON lines. No sidecar container needed.
- WhatsApp auth state (Baileys creds) stored at `{dataPath}/connections/whatsApp/{connectionId}/`
- Node process lifecycle: unpaired (no process) -> pairing (QR) -> connected. LoggedOut clears creds. Reconnect with exponential backoff (2s->30s, 10 max).
- `GET /api/connections/types` returns channel metadata (config fields, setup steps) so the frontend can build dynamic forms without hardcoded channel knowledge
- Settings app uses `IConfigurable` pattern for provider config and `IChannelProviderFactory.ConfigFields` for connection config — both render dynamic forms from backend-provided schemas

## Memory

Session-to-session notes. Save memories here in CLAUDE.md — do NOT create separate memory files. Update this section as decisions are made.

### User Preferences
- Prefers design discussions before implementation — brainstorm first, then plan, then build
- Wants to be consulted on naming and architecture, not surprised
- Values small, frequent commits over accumulated batches
- Prefers concise responses — don't over-explain
